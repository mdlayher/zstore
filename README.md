zstore [![GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/mdlayher/zstore?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/mdlayher/zstore)
======

Prototype, ZFS-based, object storage system, written in Go.  MIT Licensed.

At this time, `zstored` only runs on Linux-based operating systems.  In the future,
it will likely be possible to run the daemon on any UNIX-like operating system
which can also run ZFS.
